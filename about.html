        <h1>A bit more...</h1>
        <p>I've also played around with startups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                BitSwap: An exchange for BitClout and Ethereum, featured in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-dark-democratizing-power-of-the-social-media-stock-market" target="_blank">NYT</a>, once valued at $10 million
            </li>
            <li>
                A GenAI startup to build presentations / marketing content for startups (this only really stayed a concept)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>and competed in <a href="https://devpost.com/dhrumilp15">40+ hackathons</a>. My favourite hacks are simple, but meaningful:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A matchmaking engine based on <a href="https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2018/07/17/cca/">CCA</a> for the game Sky from ThatGameCompany (HackMIT 2022, 2nd place sponsor prize)
            </li>
            <li>
                A note-taker for my family physician (Hack The North 2019, sponsor prize)
            </li>
            <li>
                An arcade fighter game, controlled by a glove (THacks 2 (2017), 3rd place)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I really love stories (books, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/drumpelstiltskin" target="_blank">anime</a>, manhwa/webtoon) and climbing!
        </p>
        <p>
