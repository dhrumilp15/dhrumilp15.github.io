<!-- As I write this, I haven't *technically* graduated from university. However, I want to say that I can still write this piece because:

- I have 2 classes left to graduate, which can be in any subject (no mandatory subject restrictions left)
- I dropped out of co-op to start a full-time job in February (instead of graduating in April with (most of) the friends in my year ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)
- It's my blog, so I kind of set the rules here... (I promise I'll only use this card once...) -->

I'd like to go in chronological order of undergrad, with headings for each year. The headings might have weird symbols like `1A, 1B, 2A, 3B, 4A...` - those represent the year and semester for us Waterloo folk. For example, `1A` is "first year, first semester" while `3B` is "third-year, second semester".

# First Year (1A + 1B)

I remember hearing that it was a coinflip for whether this would be the best or worst year of undergrad, and I had a lot of fun in first year. I especially enjoyed the freedom and independence and making new friends!

I think my dreams/goals in first-year were:

1. **I wanted to find awesome friends**
   1. I came from a close-knit high school, and I wanted to find a group of epic friends in university.
2. **I still wanted to get decent grades**
   1. I knew that university would be harder than high school, but a boy can dream...
   2. Looking back, a big reason why I wanted to do well was because I felt that I could - a small piece of it felt like a competition with myself - if I think that I can understand the content, well, let's see what kind of grade I can get. My high school program beat the fear of getting bad grades out of me, and so I generally just wanted to see how well I could do (the fear of passing was still there, one of the biggest motivators for me to study was the fear of having to retake the class, but I had friends who retook classes and this fear is a bit overblown imo).
3. **I wanted to get a decent co-op placement** (standard waterloo overachiever dream...)
4. **I wanted to join the neurotechnology design team**
   1. (I had joined UofT's team in hs, and wanted to continue pursuing this interest into university)

I got really lucky in first year! I met awesome friends, and a bunch of my friends from high school also came to Waterloo (I'm talking around 30 people, so quite a few friends!). The new friends I made had similar interests to me - they wanted to challenge themselves academically and wanted to have fun! I still remember our awesome movie nights and parties. I had decent success with landing interviews from good companies, so I had no complaints on that front either. Clubs were a huge part of my life in high school, and I wanted to keep that going into university, which is why I was really excited to join Watolink (Waterloo's neurotech design team) as the AI subteam's lead. Truly, life could not be better.

I'm sure this cannot be true, but I do truly look back at that time with somewhat rose-coloured glasses - it felt like everything was exciting and that the future would only be bright. Oh what innocence...

# Co-op 1

Huge shoutout to all of the members of the Tuna team at A Thinking Ape for making me feel welcomed! I really liked my team's weekly book reading club, where I first saw distributed systems concepts and how to write clean code.

# Second Year

## 2A

I was lucky enough to get decent grades, an awesome co-op placement and epic friends in first-year, so my spirit heading into second year was nothing short of optimistic. I had also worked part-time during my first year of school, and thought that I should continue that into my second year (gotta pay tuition + rent somehow...). I got a remote, part-time internship in the start of my second year, led a subteam on my school's neurotech design team, wanted to take challenging classes, and wanted to get a decent job, so dedicated time to studying for interviews. If you can tell that the sweet reward for this kind of naive optimism in one's own capabilities is burnout, I'd have to say that it's not nice to read another's mind without asking first...

### Failures

I think this is where I started to see myself fail over and over, making the same mistakes over and over and believing that I had learned my lesson... over and over. My workload was roughly:

1. Part-time job
2. Subteam lead for Watolink, with the competition drawing close
3. Classes (Stat 231, CS 245, CS 246, SPCOM 225?, MATH 239) -> I do NOT recommend this course load to anyone else... do NOT do this to youself. This is a "do as I say, not as I do" moment please...
4. Job search

As you can probably guess, I over-committed myself and wound up disappointing myself and others. I failed in some way for:

1. Part-Time: I didn't commit nearly enough time to doing research as part of my position as a **research** intern (argh!!)! I seriously disappointed myself and my team - I truly believe that I had been given such an incredible opportunity and squandered it :(. I remember a friend of mine even asked why I didn't convert that term into a co-op term and I only thought, "if I could turn back time...". It wasn't that I learned nothing, but I really think I could have learned so much more if I had dedicated more time.
2. Watolink: I let down a lot of newcomers who had joined Watolink hoping to learn about using AI for neurotech but found that I was woefully inequipped to delegate work as part of the final project. I specifically remember realizing that the remaining tasks would be completed sequentially - each part of the analysis pipeline had to be built one after the other. At the time, I didn't know how to plan far enough ahead to understand what each part would like before reaching the development stage for it. Further, I learned that throwing more people or resources at a problem doesn't unfortunately solve the problem, and that I need to get better at pushing back when needed, to protect my (sub)team.
   1. In retrospect, I think mocking and careful communication would have saved the day here: each piece has inputs and outputs, so creating and communicating a simple interface for each of piece would allow them to be constructed in parallel. Ah, the luxury of hindsight.
3. In hopes of maintaining decent grades, I took away a ton of time from other aspects of my life to devote to studying for classes and exams. I did well in my technical classes, but it certainly came at the cost of my non-technical classes and my commitments to my part-time job and design team.

My experiences in Watolink, especially when we were preparing our competition submission, really burned me out of design teams. I remember one particular week that we had worked on the project non-stop, only taking breaks to sleep. We could **feel** our progress at the end of the week - our project went from a *dumpster fire* **train wreck** to a *weak* imitation of a **working demo**, but I think we all felt the emotional cost of that work. In an unfortunate twist, this led to me getting a bit more free time, but I certainly felt a sense of longing for some kind of technical community not part of school.

## 2B

Thankfully, I scaled back on my commitments outside of school. I had enough money to pay for tuition and rent, and I was too burnt out to work on a design team, even though I had joined a new one. Ah, that was unfortunately another case of overcommitment. Now, I could finally take a class that I had wanted to take ever since stumbling in as a first year: CS 484 Computational Vision with Prof. Yuri Boykov. I know, you were probably expecting something like "Drama Improv 101: How to make people laugh and have a good time", but I really did want to take that class...

This was certainly one of my hardest terms from a courseload perspective (cs 241, cs 240, cs 251, cs 484, bet 300), but I think there were some hits. I even pitched my personal project at the Velocity semi-finals, so I got a good range of experiences in this term.

## Co-Op 2

I was incredibly lucky to land an internship at Roblox. Roblox is an awesome place to work, and I really enjoyed my time there. I started interviewing for future co-op terms as well, which is where one of the biggest emotional struggles I had in university started. The only 2 companies that had postings I was interested in at the time were Snowflake and Ramp. I was lucky to get both offers, and had to push my offers around a bit so that I could do both internships. By the end of the interview rounds for both companies, I was pretty exhausted and wanted to stop interviewing for the upcoming recruiting seasons. I wanted to give myself the time to focus on my personal passions and projects (I had illusions of doing some sort of start-up).

## Co-Op 3

I was genuinely challenged technically at Snowflake, and I do a better job of going through that [here (try it and see!)](/try-it-and-see). On a more emotional note, I started to notice how I was becoming a bit more different than others - I started having trouble enjoying things that I knew others enjoyed. Now, I know what you might be thinking - I knew that different people like different things. It was more coming to terms with the realization that there were things I would prioritize ahead of traveling. I'm using traveling here as a placeholder here for something that I believe is generally enjoyed by most people (including myself just so we're clear...), but I think I was starting to learn that it was ok for me to start saying no to things that I didn't enjoy or did want to do, and to not feel guilty doing the things that I enjoy. However, like a complete idiot, I took this way too far and started rejecting everything that I didn't think I would enjoy doing (ikr, what a strategy that certainly leads one down the path of experiencing new things!).  

## 3A

Like a glutton for punishment, I decided to take another courseload of 4 technical classes and another class. As I'm writing this, I actually forgot that I took yet another term of 4 technical classes together, because that can only be described as a masochist's (favourite) dream. At the time, many of my friends were looking for internships, and I think I had felt a sense of security knowing that I had secured a job for the summer. I had most of the learnings in the last paragraph during this term.

## 3B

This was the calm before the storm. I had developed a sleeping pattern opposite to my classes: slept through most classes except for CS 350 (Operating systems) and CS 370 (Numerical Computation). In doing so, I was giving up a lot more emotional connection to others than I had realized. My policy of rejecting the things that I didn't think I would enjoy or be interested in really drove me away from others, to the point where I was effectively living in my own little bubble. I want to say that it was isolating and thus hurt me, but I actually think I hurt those closest to me more than I hurt myself. I am truly sorry for the pain that I caused here.

## Co-Op 4

This was likely my most emotionally challenging term. The people I met at Ramp were truly fun and caring, but I didn't initially give them enough of a chance. I didn't initially give New York City enough of a chance, nor did I give HackNY, the fellowship I had joined for the summer, enough of a chance. I remember being very upset at the start of the term over the many changes all at once, and that I was having trouble adapting. It didn't help that I had been emotionally isolating myself in the term prior, because I only lashed out harder at those who were still willing to hang around. I don't blame them for pulling back, since I was a difficult person at the time. That was likely my lowest point emotionally in my life (so far...). 

An English teacher I had in middle school once told me that a lot of kindness can only come from sadness. At the time, I remember not **wanting** to believe her - *why should I have to feel sadness and pain to develop kindness*? It sounded cruel to me then, and still sounds cruel now. Unfortunately, I've started to see the truth in what she said, but I do still believe in my naive desire to believe that another path to kindness exists. 

It took time, but once I started opening my mind to my coworkers, nyc and the other fellows, I realized that I had been missing out - these were some of the most genuine people I'd ever met, and I'm truly lucky to have met them at the time. They were smart and caring, and their wisdom helped me learn lesson after lesson.

Through that sadness and subsequent happiness


# taking a graduate class during my undergrad

In my last term on campus at Waterloo, I decided to dedicate the term to learn about machine learning. I had already taken Waterloo's computer vision class (CS 484) in second year, and felt like I should do a deeper dive to learn more of the fundamentals. In particular, I wanted to get a deeper understanding of machine learning, artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Turns out, I was in luck! I could take:

- CS 480: Introduction to **Machine Learning** with Prof. Yaoliang Yu
- CS 486: Introduction to **Artificial Intelligence** with Prof. Jesse Hoey and Prof. Victor Zhong
- CS 784: **Computational Linguistics** with Prof. Freda Shi

This already sounds like a pretty heavy course load, but I decided to punish myself even more and take:

- CS 454: **Distributed Systems** with Prof. Samer Al Kiswany
- CO 331: **Coding Theory** with Prof. Alfred Menezes

Truly, I was a glutton for punishment.

CS 784 was also a graduate-level class, and I'd never taken a graduate-level class before. I was concerned that the material would be too advanced for me, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that math is still math - derivatives don't change in graduate classes, and neither do expected value or matrix multiplication. In fact, coding theory (CO 331) and my machine learning class (CS 480) had some of the wackiest math I'd ever seen. (Don't get me wrong, the math was cool: Reed-Solomon codes and BCH codes are fascinating, and abstract algebra is truly powerful, but, man, was it hard).

Instead, Freda's class had a greater focus on learning NLP and linguistics fundamentals, and then applying that knowledge to review literature and research papers. Our term project was to write a meta-analysis paper on a popular word in NLP, and I chose to write about "attention" (This term gets thrown around a lot, and I wanted to discern fact from fiction).

Learning about the attention mechanism and its implementations was fun, and I also enjoyed learning about its history. For example, I thought that the attention mechanism was created for the transformer architecture {% cite vaswani2017attentionneed %}, but that credit actually goes to {% cite bahdanau2014neuralmachinetranslationjointly %}. Bahdanau's team used attention in a seq2seq model for machine translation.

If you're interested in learning more about the state of attention as of April 28, 2025, I hope you can find something useful from [my paper](/assets/paying_attention_to_attention.pdf)! This is the first machine learning paper I've ever written, and I hope to write something later that can push the field even a smidge forward.
